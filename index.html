        <p>Iâ€™m a UI/UX Developer living and working in southeastern Alabama. I started doing web and graphic 
          design in 1996 and over the last few years have started programming in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>I enjoy finding creative ways to communicate information simply and have a passion for removing 
          obstacles so customers can focus on their goals.</p>
